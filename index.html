NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday said former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh had told him there was political interference in his department.
“The allegations raised by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh are serious,” he said.
In an eight-page letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked Assistant Inspector Sachin Waze, 
arrested by the NIA in the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case, to col-smlect Rs 100 crore every month, including Rs 40-50 crore from some 1,750-odd bars
 and restaurants in Mumbai.
